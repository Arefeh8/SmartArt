SmartArt Reminder is a feature I designed and built as an extension to the SmartArt app to solve a real problem I personally experienced: forgetting to practice daily drawing due to a busy schedule. Since SmartArt is an art-focused app but lacked a reminder system, I decided to build one myself using SwiftUI in Xcode. This project helped me learn how to create a standalone screen, design a custom UI, handle navigation, and integrate the feature into an existing app structure. The result is a simple, clean reminder tool that encourages daily creativity — and in the future, I plan to extend it with an Apple Watch version for even faster and more convenient reminders.
